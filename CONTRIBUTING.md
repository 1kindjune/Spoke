# Contributing Guidelines

* Fork this repository
* Pick a ticket from the Ready section of the [project page](https://github.com/MoveOnOrg/Spoke). If you have any questions about an issue and if it is ready, please contact the maintainer of the project.
* Create a topic/feature branch.  Branch names should begin with the issue number, followed by text describing the work.  Please use lower-kebab-case (i.e. `1-contributing-guidelines`).
* If doing a larger change, break it into smaller merge-able chunks as much as possible. When not possible, open periodic WIP (Work In Progress) pull requests with clear "WIP" labeling in the title to indicate they are for discussion, but not (yet) merging.
* Complete work
* Submit a pull request (PR) against the original MoveOnOrg repository, or remove "WIP" label from any existing PR


## Quality Requirements
* All tests passing - aiming for 100% test coverage
* No linting errors
